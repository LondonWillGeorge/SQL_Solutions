Solution to https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/harry-potter-and-wands/problem
tricky SQL JOIN problem on Hacker Rank
The second select statement is needed to constrain the coins needed to minimum amount for any 'wands' which have otherwise
identical 'power' and 'age' properties.
There is no way I can see to constrain the MIN coins_needed inside first select statement as can't GROUP BY 'power' and 'age' in combination,
so second select statement needs to be nested inside the main one like this.
But there is probably even simpler way to do it, at a very advanced SQL level.

SELECT W.id, P.age, W.coins_needed, W.power FROM Wands AS W JOIN Wands_Property AS P
    ON W.code = P.code WHERE P.is_evil = 0 
    AND W.coins_needed = 
        (SELECT MIN(MINW.coins_needed) FROM Wands AS MINW JOIN Wands_Property AS MINP
        ON MINW.code = MINP.code WHERE W.power = MINW.power AND P.age = MINP.age) 
            ORDER BY Power DESC, Age DESC;
