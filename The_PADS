In this medium rank 30 point problem, the solution needs to print output in a very particular format, using brackets, initial of the 'occupation' field
value and so on.
So need to use CONCAT command to concatenate ")" brackets and so on in the right place.

In second part of results, we need total number of people in each occupation to be printed.
Therefore use COUNT command for this part.

SELECT CONCAT(Name, "(", LEFT(Occupation, 1),")") FROM OCCUPATIONS ORDER BY Name ASC;

SELECT CONCAT("There are a total of ", COUNT(Occupation), " ", LCASE(Occupation), "s.")
    FROM OCCUPATIONS GROUP BY Occupation ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation), Occupation;
