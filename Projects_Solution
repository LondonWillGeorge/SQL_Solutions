The key to this direction of solving the problem is that in this case, where the only data are start and end dates for projects,
the overall start dates for each separate project will not appear in any of the overall end dates for each separate project, and vice-versa.

The solution stems from this observation.
Following will output all the start dates which don't appear anywhere as end dates:
Select start_Date from Projects where start_date not in (select end_date from Projects)

Rest of solution built up from this.

SQL also has DATEDIFF function which is used in discussion solution for this, which might be safer for processing date values, but
this simple subtraction works for the test data anyway: 'order by (min(end_date) - s)'

*/

Select start_date s, min(end_date) from
(Select start_Date from Projects where start_date not in (select end_date from Projects)) a, 
(Select end_Date from Projects where end_date not in (select start_date from Projects)) b 
where a.start_date < b.end_date group by s order by (min(end_date) - s), s;
